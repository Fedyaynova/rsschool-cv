###__About__:


I have worked in leading publishing houses as a project, pr and sales manager about 10 years.
I participated in the production of newspapers and magazines,  but it isn’t so promising. I want to try something new.
Front end development is the only form of development that the user will actually see. It’s close for me. 
That’s why it’s a logical jump into the front end.
